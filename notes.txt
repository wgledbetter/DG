In order to avoid memory read conflicts, I think each vertex in the active list should store the values of its neighbors.
This will result in duplicate data for points which are bordered by two active list points, but according to Jeong, this is a beneficial tradeoff, especially for cuda implementations.
I do wonder about overhead in creating that data structure on each while iteration.

Does it make sense to have crtp in this?

Need Mesh::vert_closest_to(Eigen::Vector) and Mesh::verts_inside(vector<double> highs, vector<double> lows)


4 Sep:
Need to have different mesh types inherit from base mesh and be written in separate files.
Need to make sure points can't be duplicated on active list or addThese or removeThese.
Need to ensure that accessing addThese and removeThese works in parallel.

5 Sep:
To implement different solvePDE functions, use policy-based design.
    HamiltonianPolicy::solvePDE(v)
EikonalSolution will need to inherit from HamiltonianPolicy, and HamiltonianPolicy will CRTP back to EikonalSolution to see things about mesh neighbors and such

Each thread could have an addThese and a removeThese which are then conglomerated into one vector

If I break it down into a FIM class, what would it need?

how to do constraint indexing?
some verts will have no constraints and some will have two. two is the max: one seed constraint and one backprop constraint

In PontaniConway object, probably change set_T and set_mass to one set_acc. Characteristic acceleration or something.

Establish naming convention for costatedynamics()

Parameter indexing in DynamicGame
    if _PV == P_PV && _PV == E_PV
        good
    if _PV == P_PV + E_PV
        good
    else
        bad

If the game is decoupled or fully coupled, we shouldn't allow user to pass in XV or UV because those are fixed.
Also, make sure the U component is always size(E_UV+P_UV). This must be true for all separable systems.

rewrite 'process_input_state' to account for time variable

SemiDirect:75 - can't just pass 'costate' to 'adjointtransposegradient.'
Need to check dimension or fill the appropriate costate spots in a larger vector, like: [0 0 0 costate 0]

SegFault SepDynGamBas:237 matmul

Thought I fixed the segfault with std::exit, but turns out that quits the whole program, not just the function...

It's an issue with SeparableDynamicGameBase:377
Because jacobian is <XV, XV+UV> and inState is <XV+1+UV>, using xInStateControlIdx won't work

Fixed it. Next up, either write SemiDirect::jacobian() and/or port this work into ASSET/Reverie
